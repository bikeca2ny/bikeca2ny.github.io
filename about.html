	<h1>Who we are, and why we ride</h1>

	<div id="why">

		<p>Hey! We're Elizabeth and Rachel. </p>

		<p>Rachel is a scientist studyign solar cells at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Elizabeth is a science journalist, starting her PhD in engineering in the fall. We met while studying physics at UCLA.

		<p>We're taking off this spring to ride our bicycles from San Francisco to New York City. Along the way, we plan on teaching physics and renewable energy using a miniature, solar-powered bicycle we designed. We're launching a Kickstarter in February to help with manufacturing costs. Once that's complete, we'll release the .stl file for anyone to 3D-print.</p>
		
		<p>We will also be collecting innovative STEM lesson plans from teachers we meet along the way. If you teach along our route, and are interested in having us stop at your school, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

		<p>We're also looking for sponsors interested in supporting women in STEM and hands-on science education.</p>
