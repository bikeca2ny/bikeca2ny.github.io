		<h3>Hey! We're Elizabeth Case and Rachel Woods-Robinson, and we're riding our bicycles across the country for science! </h3>

		<div id="about">
		
		Before embarking on this journey, Rachel was a scientist studying solar cells at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Elizabeth was a science journalist, who will her PhD in engineering in the fall. We met while studying physics at UCLA, and have experience teaching and tutoring, as well as designing and organizing science education and outreach programs. 

		<p>We took off in Alril to ride our bicycles from San Francisco to New York City. Along our route, we are stopping at middle school classrooms to teach physics and renewable energy using a miniature, solar-powered bicycle we designed: the Sol Cycle. We believe a hands-on lesson like this one will help highlight the creative, purposeful and relevant aspects of science. We successfully reached our crowdfunding goal in March to help with manufacturing costs. We'll release the file for anyone to 3D-print during our trip.</p>
		
		<p>We will also be celebrating the front-line of STEM education: the teachers. We are profiling the educators we meet and gathering innovative STEM lesson plan from each so by the end of our trip, we'll have a small repository of terrific teaching resources. If you teach along our route, and are interested in having us stop at your school, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

		<p>We are still looking for sponsors interested in supporting women in STEM and hands-on science education. Thanks to Rock the Bike, the Noonans, Rocket Department, and others who have helped get and keep Cycle for Science on the road. Please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
