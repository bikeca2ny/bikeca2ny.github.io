		<h3>Hey! We're Elizabeth Case and Rachel Woods-Robinson. </h3>
	</div>
		<div id="about">
		
		Rachel is a scientist studying solar cells at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Elizabeth is a science journalist, starting her PhD in engineering in the fall. We met while studying physics at UCLA, and have experience teaching and tutoring, as well as designing and organizing science education and outreach programs. 

		<p>We're taking off this spring to ride our bicycles from San Francisco to New York City. Along our route, we plan on teaching physics and renewable energy to middle school science classes using a miniature, solar-powered bicycle we designed (the Sol Cycle). We think a hands-on lesson like this one will help highlight the creative, purposeful and relevant aspects of science. We're launching a Kickstarter in February to help with manufacturing costs. Once that's complete, we'll release the file for anyone to 3D-print.</p>
		
		<p>We will also be celebrating the front-line of STEM education: the teachers. We will profile  the teachers we meet, and gather innovative STEM lesson plan from each so by the end of our trip, we'll have a small repository of terrific teaching resources. If you teach along our route, and are interested in having us stop at your school, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

		<p>Right now, we are looking for sponsors interested in supporting women in STEM and hands-on science education. Please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
